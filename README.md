# Flappy-Bird
This is a Flappy Bird Game I made with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. 

Instructions:
1. Download the css, js, and sprites folder and the index.html file (make sure they are in the same folder)
2. Open the index.html file 
3. This will open the game onto a window on your web browser 
4. Play and enjoy the game :)
